# AutoThemeStruct
A basic CLI tool to generate the directory structure for an iOS icon theme to be used in conjunction with a theming engine.

NOTE: C++17 is required to build as this takes advantage of the filesystem library, allowing for cross-platform compatibility without resorting to a library such as Boost or platform-specific solutions.
